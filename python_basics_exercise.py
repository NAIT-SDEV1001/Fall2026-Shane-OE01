# Question 1: 
# Create two variables named student_name and Student_Name.
# Give them different string values, then print both variables on separate lines.
# Add a single-line comment explaining why Python treats these as
# two different variables.
student_name = "Ava"
Student_Name = "Sam"
 
print(student_name)
print(Student_Name)

# Question 2: Strings and quotation marks
# Create one string using double quotes and another using single quotes.
# Print both strings. Did it work either way or was there an error?
double_quoted_string = "Python is fun!"
single_quoted_string = 'Single quotes work too!'

print(double_quoted_string)
print(single_quoted_string) 

# Question 3: 
# Use ONE print() statement and escape sequences to display this output:
# Python Basics
#     Strings are fun!
# "Practice makes progress."
print("Python Basics\n\tStrings are fun!\n\"Practice makes progress.\"")

# Question 4: 
# Store "10" and "5" in two variables as strings. Add them and print the
# result. Then store 10 and 5 in two variables as numbers, add them, and
# print the result. Add a comment explaining why the results are different.
 
first_score_string = "10"
second_score_string = "5"
sum = first_score_string + second_score_string
print (sum)

first_score_number = 10
second_score_number = 5

sum = first_score_number + second_score_number
print (sum)

# Question 5: 
# Create variables for a person's name (string) and age (integer).
# Use the + operator to display a sentence such as "Ava is 20 years old."
# If you had any errors describe what the issue was in a short comment
person_name = "Ava"
person_age = 20

print(person_name + " is " + str(person_age) + " years old.")

# Question 6: 
# Create a constant named COURSE_NAME and assign it "Introduction to Python".
# Create variables for a student's name and current grade.
# Use an f-string to print a sentence containing the student name, grade,
# and course name. Example: "Sam has 85% in Introduction to Python."
COURSE_NAME = "Introduction to Python"
student_name = "Sam"
current_grade = 85
print(f"{student_name} has {current_grade}% in {COURSE_NAME}.")

# Question 7:
# True or False? By naming our constant in question 6 in all caps it prevented us
# from changing the value of that constant later in our code.
#FALSE


# Question 8: Student Introduction
#
# Ask the user to enter:
# - Their name
# - Their program name
# - Their favourite programming language
#
# Store each answer in a properly named variable
#
# Use an f-string and escape sequences to display the information
# on separate lines, similar to this:
#
# Student Information
#     Name: Sam
#     Program: Digital Media and IT
#     Favourite language: Python

# student_name = input("Enter your name: ")
# program_name = input("Enter your program name: ")
# favourite_language = input("Enter your favourite programming language: ")

# print (f"Student Information\n\tName: {student_name}\n\tProgram: {program_name}\n\tFavorite language: {favourite_language}")


# print(
#     "Student Information\n"
#     f"\tName: {student_name}\n"
#     f"\tProgram: {program_name}\n"
#     f"\tFavourite language: {favourite_language}"
# )



# Challenge Question!
# Create an Interactive Student Course Summary
#
# Ask the user to enter:
# - Their name
# - Their first score
# - Their bonus score
#
# Example input:
# Student name: Sam O'Neil
# First score: 85
# Bonus score: 10
#
# After receiving the input, produce this output:
#
# *** Python Results ***
# Student: Sam O'Neil
# Course: "Introduction to Python"
# Scores as strings: 85 + 10 = 8510
# Scores as numbers: 85 + 10 = 95
# Sam O'Neil's final grade in "Introduction to Python" is 95%.
#
# Requirements:
#
# 1. Create a constant named COURSE_NAME containing:
#    Introduction to Python
#
# 2. Use input() to ask the user for their name.
#    Store the input in a properly named variable.
#
# 3. Use input() to ask the user for their first score and bonus score.
#    Store both answers as strings.
#
# 5. Add the two score strings together and store the result.
#    Add a comment explaining why "85" + "10" produces "8510".
#
# 6. Convert both score strings to integers using int().
#    Add the numbers to calculate the student's final grade.
#
# 7. Use ONE print() statement to display:
#    - The heading
#    - The student's name
#    - The course name in quotation marks
#    - The result of adding the scores as strings
#    - The result of adding the scores as numbers
#
#    This print() statement must use:
#    - String concatenation with the + operator
#    - Escape sequences such as \n, \t, \' or \"
#    - str() when concatenating a number
#
# 8. Use a separate print() statement and an f-string to display:
#
#    Sam O'Neil's final grade in "Introduction to Python" is 95%.
#
# 9. Use both single and double quotation marks appropriately.
#
#
COURSE_NAME = "Introduction to Python"

student_name = input("Student name: ")
first_score_string = input("First score: ")
bonus_score_string = input("Bonus score: ")

scores_as_strings = first_score_string + bonus_score_string
# + is string concatonation

final_grade = int(first_score_string) + int(bonus_score_string)

print(
    "*** Python Results ***\n"
    + "Student: " + student_name + "\n"
    + "Course: \"" + COURSE_NAME + "\"\n"
    + "Scores as strings: " + first_score_string + " + "
    + bonus_score_string + " = " + scores_as_strings + "\n"
    + "Scores as numbers: " + first_score_string + " + "
    + bonus_score_string + " = " + str(final_grade)
)

print(f'{student_name}\'s final grade in "{COURSE_NAME}" is {final_grade}%.')
